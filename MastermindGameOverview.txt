Mastermind Game Overview

Mastermind is a code-breaking game, where users take turns (guesses) deciphering a secret code in order to win. The guesses are prompted through the movement of pegs on a grey background. 

In this particular game, the Mastermind functionality is largely based on user input from one player, in the form of guesses. Guesses yield `Feedback`, depending on whether they match the given answer or `code`. The corresponding `Feedback` is classified as either “perfect” or “imperfect” integers within the `Code` class extension, which correlate to the pegs shown on the screen. To qualify as `perfect`, the `perfect` value must be equivalent to the reduced result of the `zip` function, which accepts both a guess value and an answer value. These values correlate exactly to 4 colors: red, yellow, orange and blue, in that sequential order. If the user’s guess leads to the peg view for that exact order, the score - which can be no higher than 4 as established in the `CodeView` class - will be a `perfect` 4. 

The peg logic is established within the PegView, which conforms to UIView in the file. 

The pegs and background are programmatically drawn with the use of UIBezierPath and two control points, within the `draw` function, which is called each time the setNeedsDisplay function is called. 

`Code` is comprised of an array of colors, which is powered by the `Color` enum. The colors red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, magenta and light grey 

Whenever a new game begins, a new `Code` is generated and a new `CodeView` is generated via the drawing of a new display. The user is able to move pegs in either curved or straight line segments, according to its definition as `UIBezierPath`.

The display is comprised of:
- Rectangle: a grey-filled box which constitutes as the app’s background.
- 4 Pegs: enumerated via a range


The enum that outlines the `State` of the game ensures that, so long as the game is `in progress`, that the code remains consistent. This eliminates the possibility of the secret code changing mid-game and altering the functionality.
